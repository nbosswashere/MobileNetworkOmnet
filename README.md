# MobileNetworkOmnet
An UberEats Type Sim
Can you assist on Omnett Simulation. The main goal is to simulate a network in which there are 2 stationary nodes 1 and 2 where node 1 sends a message that gets checked by a firewall and when passed it goes to a server which then sends that message to a mobile node. That message is suppose to have a location which the mobile node then travels to sending location updates  and Latency to the server which send that info back to both stationary nodes. The mobile node then travels to that theoridical location. After reaching location it sends an acknoledgement and then begins to travel to stationary node 2 repeating similar steps of sending latency and location updates. I provided screenshots of all modules I utilized and errors I recieved. This is not fully finished and I would appreciate you providing a working simulation. Thank you once again.
